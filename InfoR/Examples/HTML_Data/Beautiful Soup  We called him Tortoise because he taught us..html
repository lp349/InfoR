<p>You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some
data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it's been
saving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround
screen scraping projects.</p>

<p>Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround
projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

</p><ol>

<li>Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms
for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for
dissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take
much code to write an application

</li><li>Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to
Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think
about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify an encoding and
Beautiful Soup can't detect one. Then you just have to specify the
original encoding.

</li><li>Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like <a href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/">html5lib</a>, allowing you
to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
flexibility.

</li></ol>

<p>Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree
traversal stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links", or
"Find all the links of class <tt>externalLink</tt>", or "Find all the
links whose urls match "foo.com", or "Find the table heading that's
got bold text, then give me that text."

</p><p>Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites
is now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take
only minutes with Beautiful Soup.

<a name="Download"></a></p><h2><a name="Download">Download Beautiful Soup</a></h2>

<p>The current release is <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/">Beautiful Soup
4.3.2</a> (October 2, 2013). You can install it with <code>pip install
beautifulsoup4</code> or <code>easy_install
beautifulsoup4</code>. It's also available as the
<code>python-beautifulsoup4</code> package in recent versions of
Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora .

</p><p>Beautiful Soup 4 works on both Python 2 (2.6+) and Python 3.

</p><p>Beautiful Soup is licensed under the MIT license, so you can also
download the tarball, drop the <code>bs4/</code> directory into almost
any Python application (or into your library path) and start using it
immediately. (If you want to do this under Python 3, you will need to
manually convert the code using <code>2to3</code>.)

</p><h3>Beautiful Soup 3</h3>

<p>Beautiful Soup 3 was the official release line of Beautiful Soup
from May 2006 to March 2012. It is considered stable, and only
critical bugs will be fixed. <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs3/documentation.html">Here's
the Beautiful Soup 3 documentation.</a>

</p><p>Beautiful Soup 3 works only under Python 2.x. It is licensed under
the same license as Python itself.

</p><p>The current release of Beautiful Soup 3 is <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.2.1.tar.gz">3.2.1</a> (February 16,
2012). You can install Beautiful Soup 3 with <code>pip install
BeautifulSoup</code> or <code>easy_install BeautifulSoup</code>. It's
also available as <code>python-beautifulsoup</code> in Debian and
Ubuntu, and as <code>python-BeautifulSoup</code> in Fedora.

</p><p>You can also download the tarball and use
<code>BeautifulSoup.py</code> in your project directly.

<p>Over the years, Beautiful Soup has been used in hundreds of
different projects. There's no way I can list them all, but I do want
to highlight a few high-profile projects. Beautiful Soup isn't what
makes these projects interesting, but it did make their completion easier:

</p><ul>

<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/arts/design/25vide.html">"Movable
 Type"</a>, a work of digital art on display in the lobby of the New
 York Times building, uses Beautiful Soup to scrape news feeds.

</li><li>Reddit uses Beautiful Soup to <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/85f9cff3e2ab9bb8f19b96acd8da4ebacc079f04/r2/r2/lib/media.py">parse
a page that's been linked to and find a representative image</a>.

</li><li>Alexander Harrowell uses Beautiful Soup to <a href="http://www.harrowell.org.uk/viktormap.html">track the business
 activities</a> of an arms merchant.

</li><li>The developers of Python itself used Beautiful Soup to <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/tracker/importer/">migrate the Python
bug tracker from Sourceforge to Roundup</a>.

</li><li>The <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/">Lawrence Journal-World</a>
uses Beautiful Soup to <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2010/nov/02/news-done-broke/">gather
statewide election results</a>.

</li><li>The <a href="http://esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/fab/">NOAA's Forecast
Applications Branch</a> uses Beautiful Soup in <a href="http://laps.noaa.gov/topograbber/">TopoGrabber</a>, a script for
downloading "high resolution USGS datasets."

</li></ul>
